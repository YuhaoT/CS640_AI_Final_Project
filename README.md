# CS640_AI_Final_Project
AI Final Project for BU CS640 
All data put under ./data folder with a ./profile pics folder inside
It would like something similar like the tree below
```
|-- data/
  |-- User demo profiles.json
  |-- Twitter_User_Handles_labeled_tweets.json
  |-- labeled_users.csv
  |-- profile pics/
     |-- 1.png
     |-- 2.png
```

如果要commit `.ipynb` 记得先重新跑一遍， 不然不同cell number 会conflict

#Write down your progress or what you did in the report_draft.txt, so that is will be easier for us to write the report at the end.

#Removed all unrelated images and restored the images path

### Bill：
In profilePic_indicate_race.ipynb, cleaned and filtered csv from dataset1, and get tensors of faces.

TODO: build a model to train with race_tensor relationship.
